# Offline JWT Decoder

A simple **offline JWT decoder** that runs entirely in your browser — no data is sent anywhere.  
Inspired by [jwt.io](https://jwt.io), but designed for local and private use.

## ✨ Features

- Runs 100% offline (just open the `index.html` file in your browser).
- Live highlighting of JWT parts (header, payload, signature).
- Pretty-printed JSON output for header and payload.
- Works in any modern browser (no dependencies).

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/klausnitzer/jwt_tools.git
   ```
